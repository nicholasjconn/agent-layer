## Issue Tracking
1. **Proactive Auditing:** If you encounter code that is problematic or violates best practices, add it to `.agentlayer/docs/ISSUES.md`.
2. **Liberal Logging:** Liberally log any issues, violations of best practices, or necessary refactors found during your work to `.agentlayer/docs/ISSUES.md` if they are not being immediately addressed.
3. **Issue Hygiene:** Before adding to `.agentlayer/docs/ISSUES.md`, review it to prevent duplicates. Consolidate where possible.
