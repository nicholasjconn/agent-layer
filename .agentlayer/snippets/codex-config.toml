# Add to your ~/.codex/config.toml (or manage via `codex mcp` CLI commands).
#
# Notes:
# - Codex stores MCP configuration in ~/.codex/config.toml and the CLI and IDE extension share it.
# - Codex clients currently surface MCP **tools**. They do not expose MCP **prompts** as first-class slash commands.
#   Use the generated repo-local Skills under `.codex/skills/` for workflow invocation.
#
# Example MCP tool servers (edit to match what you actually use):
#
# [mcp_servers.context7]
# command = "npx"
# args = ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
#
# [mcp_servers.github]
# command = "npx"
# args = ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"]
# env_vars = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
