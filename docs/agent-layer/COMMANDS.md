# Commands

Purpose: Canonical, repeatable commands for this repository (tests, coverage, lint/format, typecheck, build, run, migrations, scripts).

Notes for updates:
- Keep entries concise and practical.
- Prefer commands that will be used repeatedly.
- Organize commands using headings that fit the repository. Create headings as needed.
- For each command, document purpose, command, where to run, and prerequisites.
- When commands change, update this file and remove stale entries.
- If the repository is a monorepo, group commands per workspace/package/service and specify the working directory.

Entry format:
- <Short purpose>
```bash
<command>
```
Run from: <repo root or path>  
Prerequisites: <only if critical>  
Notes: <optional constraints or tips>
