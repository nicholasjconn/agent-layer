# Context

Note: This is an agent-layer memory file. It is primarily for agent use.

## Purpose
Persistent project-specific knowledge that does not belong in ISSUES, BACKLOG, DECISIONS, or COMMANDS. Read this file before starting work on a task.

Record three categories of information here:
1. **Project context** — domain concepts, architectural invariants, naming conventions, external dependencies, environment setup notes, team norms, and any other stable facts an agent needs to work effectively in this repository.
2. **Project-specific nuances** — non-obvious behaviors, implicit conventions, or user-provided clarifications that an agent would not discover from reading the code alone. When a user corrects a misunderstanding or explains how something actually works in this project, record it here.
3. **Lessons learned** — repeated mistakes, surprising behaviors, non-obvious gotchas, and corrective patterns discovered during development. When an error recurs or a workaround is needed more than once, record it here so future agents avoid the same mistake.

Do not duplicate information that belongs in other memory files:
- Deferred bugs or tech debt → ISSUES.md
- Planned features → BACKLOG.md
- Workflow commands → COMMANDS.md
- Non-obvious decisions → DECISIONS.md

## Format
- Organize by topic using headings (`##`, `###`).
- Prefer concise bullet points. State facts directly; omit hedging language.
- Before adding an entry, search this file for existing coverage. Merge into or update an existing section instead of creating a near-duplicate.
- Remove or update entries when the underlying facts change.
- Insert all content below `<!-- ENTRIES START -->`.

## Skill sources

- Agent Layer projects two skill source tiers: user-managed `.agent-layer/skills/` and Git-imported `.agent-layer/skills-imported/`. Both project identically. The imported tier is fully managed: a directory without a `.agent-layer/skills.lock.json` entry, or a name owned by both tiers, is a loud error rather than a silent shadow.
- The project lock (`.agent-layer/sync.lock`, owned by `internal/projectlock`) serializes skill-source reads and mutations with projection. Production entry points load their source snapshot **inside** that lock; loading before acquiring it can observe a half-applied `al skills` mutation.
- Both source tiers use one strict `skilltree.Tree` policy: uppercase `SKILL.md` is required, unknown frontmatter fields remain opaque, and symlinks plus every other non-directory, non-regular node are rejected. The immutable loaded tree is reused for validation, hashing, import behavior, and every client projection.
- `.agents/skills/` and `.claude/skills/` are exclusively owned disposable projections. Sync builds each complete root at a fixed sibling staging path, replaces the live root wholesale, and discards interrupted staging/output state on retry; it never preserves direct edits, extra entries, or ownership markers in those roots. Init and upgrade do not inspect these roots for ownership or block on their contents.
- `.agent-layer/skills.lock.json` is a trust boundary, not just a cache: its values become filesystem paths inside destination checkouts and merge bases for Git operations, so `internal/skilllock` strictly validates every persisted invariant at parse *and* marshal time.
- Every imported skill's lock entry is its sole upstream merge base and convergence state. Import blocks are configuration shorthand only; partial success may leave their members at different commits, and new membership locks immediately at the operation's current resolved target.
- Failure scope for `al skills` operations: a source-level fetch, authentication, or ref failure blocks its whole block (and every blocked skill is still reported individually); a per-skill validation, merge, or freshness failure blocks only that skill. `al skills add` and `al skills remove` are the exception — they preflight the entire desired-set change and leave local state untouched if any part of it fails.

## DeepSWE benchmark

- The public benchmark workflow is `al benchmark init <selection.json>`, optional study-scoped `al benchmark readiness --study <study.toml>`, then `al benchmark run <study.toml>`. Init generates a minimal benchmark-safe provider config and snapshots current instruction sources plus projected skills. The CLI chooses safe concurrency, checks Docker capacity before pulls, reclaims certification-only images, and emits stage/percentage progress with a 60-second inactivity heartbeat. The study names a website selection (historical v1/v2 remain valid; v3 is canonical) and explicit content-addressed experiments; task filters and worker count are invocation controls only. Private legacy campaign evidence under `.agent-layer/state/benchmarks/deepswe/campaigns/` remains untouched and is not migrated.
- The website exports schema-v3 `deepswe-benchmark-selection` with explicit manual exclusions and per-task pinned published sample size/variance. It ranks deterministic correlation evidence, excludes nonpositive OLS residual variances, applies exclusions and published-model headroom before budget walking, and renormalizes remaining precision weights. Its optional published comparison is descriptive and inert to selection. Report generation uses only the pinned selection and never fetches planner data.
- The embedded public v1.1 snapshot is a reviewed offline input, not runtime web data. Its results use `mini-swe-agent`, so published-only output is reference-relative and cannot attribute a difference to Agent Layer.
- Study reports contain only declared experiments and every selected task, including partial cells. Pairwise inference prefers observed within-cell run variance when every required task has at least two completed repetitions in both arms. Otherwise a schema-v3 selection may use labeled `published_proxy` inference: the same pinned published sample variance is shared by both arms as `combined = (weight*slope)² * s² * (1/rL + 1/rR)` with one Satterthwaite term per task. Schema-v2 selections without pinned evidence stay unavailable at one repetition. Comparisons use two-sided Student-t p-values and Holm adjustment over available pairs. Skills experiments declare `required_dispatch_roles`; a nonempty contract is conformant only when each required slot has a distinct completed fresh-root lifecycle matching that role's workflow skill and configured target. Workflow-noncompliant completed runs keep their scores, costs, and artifacts, but any pair involving them is unavailable. Three observed repetitions are preferable for stability.
- DeepSWE cost evidence counts exactly one coordinator and each completed child session once. Codex 0.145.0 exposes cache-write input tokens, so populated and internally consistent telemetry produces exact token-derived API-equivalent cost. Legacy, absent, all-zero, or inconsistent cache-write telemetry retains minimum/maximum bounds; midpoints are presentation-only. Claude reports an exact coordinator cost through Pier and an exact `total_cost_usd` for each dispatched child, so no Claude pricing estimate is used. Grok and subscription-authenticated Antigravity retain their provider JSON streams and reconstruct per-request API-equivalent costs from the embedded official-rate asset; these are comparison values, not claims about marginal subscription billing. Cache creation is ordinary input, cache reads use their documented discounted rate, and reasoning is validated as included in output rather than double charged. Missing tier evidence yields a range; missing or duplicate child usage is a normalization failure. Antigravity model slugs must encode the same reasoning tier recorded by the study. Reports render horizontal cost-accounting bounds only when present; verifier build failures remain scored evidence and are labeled on task rows.
- Every experiment receives the same versioned 4× Pier timeout resource contract, persisted in arm identity. A released host injects a checksum-verified matching Linux release binary; a development checkout builds current source and records commit/dirty provenance. Reports make evidence-backed provider-client warnings but do not infer comparability warnings from worker concurrency.
- Paid cells write a durable execution checkpoint before Pier starts and mark proven clean provider completion before separate verification. Failures retain and report the host-mounted stage and block another provider call. Only proven verifier-phase failures use the retained patch in a no-provider Pier adapter; agent-phase and ambiguous failures fail closed. Replay merges verifier fields without discarding Pier result extensions, preserves the original paid-event duration, and records replay provenance on the canonical receipt. A verifier that finishes unsuccessfully after a proven provider completion, and a failed replay, keep the checkpoint and the retained stage rather than becoming a failed receipt, because the scheduler resumes failed receipts at provider expense. The byte-exact provider patch is preserved under `agent-layer-replay/` in the stage before sanitization and is excluded from promoted evidence; the live progress watcher is advisory, and provider completion is proven only from the final stage after Pier exits.
- Agent-side readiness overlays use a logical identity derived from the pinned base image and exact overlay source; Docker image IDs are runtime build metadata and must not enter task, arm, or study identity. Grok benchmark cells use its built-in `devbox` profile because Pier already supplies the disposable container boundary; dry-run and paid adapter commands share that profile.

## Secrets

- Codex is the one exception to "never embed secrets in generated configs": it embeds secrets in URLs/env via `bearer_token_env_var`, and shell environment takes precedence over `.agent-layer/.env`. All other clients use placeholder syntax in generated configs.
- `.codex/config.toml` is shared Codex state patched by `al sync`, not a fully generated artifact. It keeps a `PARTIALLY GENERATED FILE` warning because it may contain resolved secrets, but sync preserves unrelated Codex/user runtime entries and only refreshes known Agent Layer-owned paths.

## VS Code and editor integrations

- The Codex VS Code extension reads `CODEX_HOME` only at process startup. Agent Layer launchers set repo-local `CODEX_HOME` only when `agents.codex.local_config_dir = true`; absent/false preserves inherited `CODEX_HOME`.
- The Claude VS Code extension shares MCP scope with Claude CLI: both read the same `.mcp.json`/`.claude/settings.json`. Configuring separate MCP server sets for the two surfaces is not possible. `[agents.claude_vscode]` is config-only.
- `.vscode/settings.json` updates only validate JSONC content inside the managed markers. Invalid JSONC outside the markers is not detected once the markers are present.

## Codex MCP headers

- Codex MCP header projection accepts exactly three placeholder formats: `bearer_token_env_var` for `Authorization: Bearer ${VAR}`, `env_http_headers` for exact `${VAR}` values, and `http_headers` for literal strings. Mixed literal + env placeholder (e.g. `Token ${VAR}`) is rejected and must be restructured.
- Codex project trust is seeded only when the exact `[projects."<absolute repo root>"]` entry is absent. Existing exact project entries are preserved so local trust edits survive. Malformed `agents.codex.agent_specific.projects` shapes fail sync loudly.

## Wizard feature-disable toggles → client keys

- The wizard's per-feature "disable" toggles map to these `agent_specific` keys (written only when the user opts in; absence = client default):
  - Codex (`agents.codex.agent_specific.features`, appended to `.codex/config.toml`): `browser_use`/`in_app_browser`/`computer_use = false` (browser/computer-use), `apps = false` (built-in apps).
  - Claude (`agents.claude.agent_specific`, deep-merged into `.claude/settings.json`): `env.CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_CONNECT_IDE = "false"` (IDE open-file reading), `env.ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS = "false"` (claude.ai connectors), `autoMemoryEnabled = false` (auto-memory).
  - AskUserQuestion is the exception: it is a typed `agents.claude.disable_question_tool` bool, not an `agent_specific` key (its value is array-shaped — a `permissions.deny` entry and a `PreToolUse` hook — which the line-based wizard patcher cannot safely union with user entries). When true, `buildClaudeSettings` (`internal/sync/claude_question_tool.go`) injects the deny entry (array-union/dedup) and the PreToolUse hook (dedup by matcher) into the generated settings, after the agent_specific merge so user deny/hooks are preserved. The hook is always emitted (enforces the block under YOLO, where `permissions.deny` is skipped).
- Value types: settings.json `env` values are JSON strings, so the wizard writes the quoted string `"false"`; `autoMemoryEnabled` and the Codex `features.*` flags are booleans (`false`). `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY` is deliberately not used (it takes `1`/`0`, not `false`).
- The Claude patch writer (`applyClaudeAgentSpecificUpdate`, `internal/wizard/patch.go`) writes dotted `agent_specific.*` keys into `[agents.claude]` unless the user expanded `agent_specific` into explicit sub-tables (`[agents.claude.agent_specific(.env)]`), in which case it writes the leaf into that section to avoid a TOML duplicate-table error.

## Antigravity

- Antigravity uses the `agy` binary and is launched with `--gemini_dir=<repo>/.agy` plus `AGY_CLI_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=1` for repo-local containment. Agent Layer writes `.agy/antigravity-cli/settings.json` and `.agy/antigravity-cli/mcp_config.json`.
- Antigravity model selection is `agents.antigravity.model` and sync projects it into generated `settings.json`; `agents.antigravity.agent_specific.model` is unsupported because `model` is an Agent Layer-owned field.
- `agy` v1.0.0 migrates `.agy/antigravity-cli/mcp_config.json` into `<gemini_dir>/config/mcp_config.json`. The probe seeds a real protocol server (`al __probe-mcp-fixture`) instead of `/usr/bin/true`, so MCP capability flags are evidence about `agy`. Use `al probe agy` when checking whether upstream behavior has changed.
- Observed agy 1.1.16 contained-probe baseline. The disposable `agy --print` process is passed probe-only `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and `--sandbox`; stdout-derived visibility and `mcp_tool_invoked` are measured under that diagnostic auto-approval plus terminal sandbox, not default headless permission prompting. `permissions_loaded` still reports that the seeded allow/deny settings were loaded. Observed flags: `permissions_loaded` true, `mcp_config_migrated` true, `mcp_runtime_discovery` false, `mcp_tool_invoked` true, `workspace_permissions_read` false, `instructions_loaded` true, `skill_names_visible` false, `mcp_config_names_visible` true, `shared_skill_dedup_observed` false. `mcp_tool_invoked` is not default unapproved MCP support; `mcp_runtime_discovery` remains false.

## Grok

- Grok uses the `grok` binary. Interactive launch is `al grok`; headless dispatch is `al dispatch start --agent grok`.
- Project MCP, permissions, and optional `agents.grok.agent_specific.plugins` settings are written to `.grok/config.toml`. Other Grok settings are user-level and are rejected under `agent_specific` because project config would ignore them. That path is Agent Layer-generated output and is gitignored. Grok also discovers root `.mcp.json`, `AGENTS.md`, and `.agents/skills/`.
- The Claude instruction shim is `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, not root `CLAUDE.md`. When Grok is enabled, sync sets `[compat.claude] agents = false` in `.grok-config/config.toml`, and launch/dispatch/vscode set `GROK_CLAUDE_AGENTS_ENABLED=false`, so Grok does not also load that Claude file. The Claude chime handler recognizes and silently ignores Grok's camelCase compatibility invocation so the dedicated Grok hook remains the single notification path.
- `al grok`, Grok dispatch, and `al vscode` always set `GROK_HOME=<repo>/.grok-config`. If Grok is disabled, `al vscode` clears only a stale repo-local `GROK_HOME`.
- YOLO maps to `--permission-mode bypassPermissions --always-approve` and leaves sandbox off. Headless dispatch maps non-YOLO approvals to `--sandbox workspace` when commands are approved and `--sandbox read-only` otherwise, plus `acceptEdits`/`dontAsk` and `--allow`. Interactive `al grok` writes `[permission] allow` into `.grok/config.toml` and leaves Grok's own sandbox default so a human can still approve writes.
- `agents.grok.disable_memory = true` adds `--no-memory` and `GROK_MEMORY=0`. Grok 1.0.5 does not provide a verified project-level mechanism for force-disabling installed user plugins, so Agent Layer exposes no plugin-disable toggle.
- Sync seeds `.grok-config/trusted_folders.toml` for the current repo root when that exact folder entry is absent, and writes `[compat.claude] agents = false` into `.grok-config/config.toml` (creating the file or merging that key). It creates `.grok-config` with owner-only `0700` permissions, tightens an existing real directory that grants group/other access, and rejects symlinks or non-directories so trust seeding and Grok credentials remain repo-local and private. Creation and permission tightening bind to a parent-directory handle and a no-follow open of the final `.grok-config` component, so a replacement symlink cannot redirect those operations. `al grok`, Grok dispatch, and `al vscode` create or tighten the same home before the Grok CLI can mkdir it at `0755`.
- Headless dispatch writes the prompt to `prompt.txt` in the run directory and passes `--no-auto-update`, `--prompt-file`, `--output-format streaming-json`, and either `--session-id` or `--resume`. Stream reduction handles typed progress events, bounds each retained `data` event before adding it to the separately bounded final-answer accumulator, and requires a successful `end` event with the caller-assigned session ID.
- The supported Grok provider version is `1.0.5`. `al doctor` warns (does not fail) if `grok` is missing or older. `al probe grok` runs a workspace-sandboxed capability probe in a disposable home, borrowing only an existing `auth.json` for the process and removing the copy afterward; stdout and stderr are each retained up to 32 MiB while the process runs, and overflow fails the probe while preserving bounded forensic artifacts. `agents.grok.enabled` is required; the `0.17.0` migration defaults it to `false`.
- `notifications.chime` projects a managed Stop hook to `.grok/hooks/agent-layer-chime.json`. The handler accepts Grok's camelCase payload and chimes only for a main-session `end_turn` with `stopHookActive` false and no background tasks or session crons. Folder trust is seeded under `.grok-config/trusted_folders.toml`. Do not put hooks in `agents.grok.agent_specific`; project `.grok/config.toml` does not load hook tables.

## Agent Dispatch

- Agent Dispatch's public request/API shapes should stay caller- and provider-agnostic. Target-specific model or option discovery belongs behind the target/provider registry, not as fields like `AntigravityModels` on dispatch request structs.
- Agent Dispatch is asynchronous and handle-based. Its read-only `options` command discovers valid targets and overrides; its only lifecycle operations are `start`, `wait`, `continue`, and `cancel`. Parallel work uses independent conversations rather than a fanout resource.
- Agent Dispatch has two surfaces over one backend: the built-in `agent-layer` MCP server (`al dispatch mcp-server`, exposing `dispatch_options`/`dispatch_start`/`dispatch_wait`/`dispatch_continue`/`dispatch_cancel`/`dispatch_inspect`/`dispatch_output`) is the canonical agent-facing path, and the CLI is the human/scripting path. MCP handlers render through the same operations into private buffers and decode the canonical JSON result; nothing but the MCP SDK writes to the server's stdout. Cancelling an MCP request stops only that wait; only `cancel` stops provider work. `invocation_id` is the immutable `RunRecord.ID`. `termination_confirmed` is independent of outcome; launch intent without published process identity is uncertainty, never proof that no provider exists. Public inspection exposes only confirmation and its timestamp; output is limited to bounded `final_answer` and `events` text.
- The built-in MCP server is derived state, not an `[[mcp.servers]]` entry. `internal/projection.EffectiveMCPServers`/`EffectiveServerIDs` is the single boundary that adds it, so native projection, permission allowlists, warning accounting, and doctor all see the same set.
- Immutable run records are canonical history. Friendly names are lookup mappings, and factual workflow manifests must not carry recommendation, risk, readiness, confidence, verdict, or synthesis fields between independent stages.

## Pin file recovery

- Empty or non-semver `.agent-layer/al.version` pin files are treated as "no pin" and auto-repaired by `al init`/`al upgrade` without prompts. The user sees a warning, never a hard error. A broken pin file must never make the CLI unusable.

## Upgrade and migration internals

- When source version cannot be resolved during `al upgrade`, source-agnostic migration operations still execute; source-gated operations are skipped with deterministic report entries. Ambiguous repos may need an explicit follow-up if the skip report flags missed transitions.
- Multi-version upgrades chain migration manifests: all manifests between source (exclusive) and target (inclusive) load in order with per-operation deduplication by ID. When source is unknown, only the target manifest loads (backward compatible). Manifests must have unique operation IDs across the chain or later duplicates are silently skipped.
- The required-field migration guardrail uses a baseline allowlist for fields that predate manifest enforcement (baseline version `0.8.1`). The allowlist must be maintained when introducing new required fields; stale entries can hide drift if not reviewed.

## E2E test harness

- `scripts/test-e2e/harness.sh` authenticates GitHub API calls with `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN` when available (raises the limit from 60 req/hr to 5000 req/hr). CI exports the token to `make ci`. Unauthenticated fallback is preserved for local offline runs.

## Test policy

- Do not write tests that assert specific wording, language, headings, or prose contracts in skill and instruction templates. Those checks are tautological and brittle. Tests may verify Agent Layer mechanics such as parsing, validation, sync/projection, resource copying, file existence/absence, and generated artifacts.
- When a test must confirm a template/instruction file was seeded or written in full (not stubbed/truncated), compare the output against the template read at runtime (`templates.Read(<path>)`) and key dedup/occurrence checks on the migration op's own fields (`op.Match`/`op.From`/`op.Value`) — never hardcode template prose as the proxy. Runtime comparison tracks the source of truth, survives content edits, and still catches stub/truncation regressions (see `TestExecuteAppendToFile_*` in `internal/install`).

## Root resolution in cmd/al tests

- Root resolution (`internal/root` `FindAgentLayerRoot`/`FindRepoRoot`) walks upward from the working dir and stops only at a `.agent-layer/` or the filesystem root — there is no intermediate ceiling. `cmd/al` tests run from `t.TempDir()` (under the OS temp dir) and assume no ancestor holds a `.agent-layer`.
- A stray `.agent-layer` above the temp dir — e.g. `/tmp/.agent-layer` left by running `al init`/`al wizard`/`make al-*` while `cd`'d into `/tmp` — makes resolution escape the test sandbox. Symptoms: `cmd/al` tests fail with `got "/tmp"` or `already initialized in an ancestor directory (/tmp)`. Fix: `rm -rf /tmp/.agent-layer`, and don't run `al init` from `/tmp`. CI runners are clean, so this is a local-only gotcha.
