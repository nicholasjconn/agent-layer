## Decision Log

<!-- ENTRIES START -->

- Decision 2026-01-22 f1e2d3c: Distribution model (global CLI with per-repo pinning)
    Decision: Ship a single globally installed `al` CLI with per-repo version pinning via `.agent-layer/al.version` and cached binaries.
    Reason: A single entrypoint reduces support burden while pinning keeps multi-repo setups reproducible.

- Decision 2026-01-17 e5f6a7b: MCP architecture (external servers + internal prompt server)
    Decision: External MCP servers are user-defined in `config.toml`. The internal prompt server (`al mcp-prompts`) exposes slash commands automatically and is not user-configured.
    Reason: Users need arbitrary MCP servers while slash command discovery should be consistent and automatic.

- Decision 2026-01-17 f6a7b8c: Approvals policy (4-mode system)
    Decision: Implement `approvals.mode` with four options: `all`, `mcp`, `commands`, `none`. Project the closest supported behavior per client.
    Reason: A small fixed set is easier to understand than per-client knobs; behavior may differ slightly across clients.

- Decision 2026-01-17 a7b8c9d: VS Code launchers for CODEX_HOME
    Decision: Provide repo-specific VS Code launchers that set `CODEX_HOME` at process start.
    Reason: The Codex extension reads `CODEX_HOME` only at startup; launchers ensure correct repo context.

- Decision 2026-01-17 c9d0e1f: Antigravity limited support
    Decision: Antigravity supports instructions and slash commands only (no MCP, no approvals). Slash commands map to skills at `.agent/skills/<command>/SKILL.md`.
    Reason: Antigravity integration is best-effort; core clients (Gemini, Claude, VS Code, Codex) have full parity.

- Decision 2026-01-18 e1f2a3b: Secret handling (Codex exception)
    Decision: Generated configs use client-specific placeholder syntax so secrets are never embedded. Exception: Codex embeds secrets in URLs/env and uses `bearer_token_env_var` for headers. Shell environment takes precedence over `.agent-layer/.env`.
    Reason: Prevents accidental secret exposure; Codex limitations require an exception.

- Decision 2026-01-25 edefea6: Sync dependency injection for system calls
    Decision: Added a `System` interface with a `RealSystem` implementation and threaded it through `internal/sync` writers and prompt resolution instead of patching globals.
    Reason: Removes test-only global state and enables parallel-safe unit tests.
    Tradeoffs: Adds `sys System` parameters and test stubs for filesystem/process operations.

- Decision 2026-01-25 b4c5d6e: Centralize VS Code launcher paths
    Decision: Centralize VS Code launcher paths in `internal/launchers` and consume them from sync and install.
    Reason: Single source of truth prevents drift and accidental deletion of generated artifacts.
    Tradeoffs: Adds a small shared package dependency for sync and install.
