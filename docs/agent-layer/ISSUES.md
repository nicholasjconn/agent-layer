# Issues

Purpose: Deferred defects, maintainability refactors, technical debt, risks, and engineering concerns.

Notes for updates:
- Add an entry only when you are not fixing it now.
- Keep each entry 3 to 5 lines (the first line plus 2 to 4 indented lines).
- Lines 2 to 5 must be indented by 4 spaces so they stay associated with the entry.
- Prevent duplicates by searching and merging.
- Remove entries when fixed.

## Open issues

<!-- ENTRIES START -->

- Issue 2026-01-20 d6ea375: Wizard rewrites inline comments during configuration edits
    Priority: Medium. Area: wizard configuration editing.
    Description: When editing TOML values, inline comments are re-emitted as leading comments, changing the original layout users may want to preserve.
    Next step: Decide whether to document this behavior or adopt a formatter that preserves inline comment placement.

- Issue 2026-01-20 d6ea375: Wizard comment parsing does not handle all TOML string forms
    Priority: Low. Area: wizard configuration editing.
    Description: Inline comment extraction treats hashes inside multiline or literal strings as comments, which can mis-handle valid TOML.
    Next step: Remove inline comment extraction or switch to parser-aware comment handling.

- Issue 2026-01-20 d6ea375: Restored Model Context Protocol servers inherit template positions
    Priority: Low. Area: wizard configuration editing.
    Description: Restored server blocks reuse template position metadata, but comment preservation reads the original configuration lines, which can mis-associate or drop comments.
    Next step: Clone restored server nodes with cleared positions or skip comment preservation for newly appended servers.

- Issue 2026-01-20 d6ea375: Wizard patch tests do not assert comment placement
    Priority: Low. Area: wizard tests.
    Description: The tests only check that a comment exists, not whether inline comment placement is preserved or intentionally moved.
    Next step: Add assertions for the exact expected comment placement behavior.

- Issue 2026-01-19 ceddb83: `.agent-layer/.env` overrides shell environment variables
    Priority: Medium. Area: environment handling.
    Description: When launching via `./al`, values from `.agent-layer/.env` override existing shell environment variables, and empty template keys can shadow valid tokens.
    Next step: Decide precedence and update environment merge logic or templates to avoid overriding with empty values; document the chosen behavior.

- Issue 2026-01-18 e5f6g7: Slash commands not output for antigravity
    Priority: Medium. Area: antigravity support.
    Description: Slash commands are not being output when antigravity mode is enabled.
    Next step: Investigate where slash commands are generated and ensure antigravity support is included.

- Issue 2026-01-18 h8i9j0: DECISIONS.md grows too large and consumes excessive tokens
    Priority: Medium. Area: project memory.
    Description: The decisions log grows unbounded as entries accumulate, eventually consuming too many tokens when agents read it for context.
    Next step: Consider archiving old decisions, summarizing completed phases, or splitting into a compact summary plus detailed archive.

- Issue 2026-01-18 b1c2d3: Memory file path convention investigation
    Priority: Low. Area: project memory.
    Description: Should memory files use full relative paths or just filenames in 01_memory.md and slash commands?
    Next step: Audit current usage and establish a single convention for referring to memory files.

- Issue 2026-01-18 e4f5g6: Memory file template structure investigation
    Priority: Medium. Area: templates.
    Description: Should templates in .agent-layer only contain headers, and how should generated content be handled when overwriting?
    Next step: Review existing template synchronization logic and define the intended behavior for content preservation.

- Issue 2026-01-18 a7b8c9: Boost coverage slash command too conservative
    Priority: High. Area: slash commands.
    Description: The boost-coverage command only picks one file at a time and stops too early. It should iterate until coverage targets are met, even if it requires many tests.
    Next step: Refactor the boost-coverage logic to support continuous iteration and multiple file targets in a single run.

- Issue 2026-01-18 f1g2h3: Codex initial reasoning effort should be high
    Priority: Medium. Area: configuration templates.
    Description: The initial example configuration for Codex sets reasoning_effort to "xhigh", which can be unnecessarily expensive or slow for a default. It should be "high".
    Next step: Update `internal/templates/config.toml` and `README.md` to use "high" instead of "xhigh".

- Issue 2026-01-18 i4j5k6: Remove MY_TOKEN from default configuration template
    Priority: Low. Area: configuration templates.
    Description: The `MY_TOKEN` placeholder in the default configuration template is unnecessary and should be removed to keep the default config clean. It can remain in the README as an example of environment variable usage.
    Next step: Remove `MY_TOKEN` from `internal/templates/config.toml`.

- Issue 2026-01-18 k7l8m9: Set MCP servers to enabled by default
    Priority: Medium. Area: configuration templates.
    Description: Current MCP server examples in the default configuration are disabled by default. They should be enabled by default to provide a better out-of-the-box experience when tokens are provided.
    Next step: Update `internal/templates/config.toml` to set `enabled = true` for default MCP servers.

- Issue 2026-01-18 l8m9n0: Limit exposed commands for GitHub MCP
    Priority: Medium. Area: mcp configuration.
    Description: The GitHub MCP server exposes many tools. We should explicitly list only the necessary commands in the configuration to reduce noise and potential security risks.
    Next step: Research useful GitHub MCP commands and configure `args` or `commands` whitelist in the default config template.

- Issue 2026-01-19 f2g3h4: Wizard sets Codex reasoning effort to xhigh by default
    Priority: Medium. Area: wizard defaults.
    Description: The wizard implementation hardcodes the default reasoning effort for Codex to "xhigh", which may be too aggressive/expensive for a default. It should align with the template default (which is also currently xhigh but planned to change to high).
    Next step: Change `internal/wizard/catalog.go` default to "high" once the template decision is finalized.

- Issue 2026-01-19 i5j6k7: Wizard model catalogs require manual updates
    Priority: Low. Area: maintenance.
    Description: The list of supported models in `internal/wizard/catalog.go` is hardcoded. New model releases will require code changes to appear in the wizard.
    Next step: Consider fetching the model list dynamically or adding a "Custom..." option in the wizard.

- Issue 2026-01-19 j6k7l8: Generated .mcp.json does not adhere to Claude MCP server schema
    Priority: High. Area: MCP configuration generation.
    Description: Claude fails to parse the generated `.mcp.json` file, reporting that `mcpServers.github` and `mcpServers.tavily` do not adhere to the MCP server configuration schema.
    Next step: Compare the generated schema against Claude's expected MCP server configuration format and fix the output structure.

- Issue 2026-01-19 k7l8m9: COMMANDS.md purpose unclear in instructions
    Priority: Low. Area: documentation.
    Description: The instructions do not clearly state that COMMANDS.md is only for development workflow commands (build, test, lint), not for documenting all application commands or CLI usage.
    Next step: Update 01_memory.md to explicitly clarify that COMMANDS.md covers development commands only.

- Issue 2026-01-19 c9d2e1: Wizard UI depends on pre-release Charmbracelet packages
    Priority: Low. Area: dependencies.
    Description: `github.com/charmbracelet/huh` v0.8.0 requires pseudo versions of bubbles and colorprofile, leaving go.mod on pre-release commits.
    Next step: Re-evaluate when upstream tags stable releases or update the wizard UI dependency once stable versions are available.
