- Issue 2026-01-24 a1b2c3: VS Code slow first launch in agent-layer folder
    Priority: Low. Area: developer experience.
    Description: Launching VS Code in the agent-layer folder takes a very long time on first use, likely due to extension initialization, indexing, or MCP server startup.
    Next step: Profile VS Code startup to identify the bottleneck (extensions, language servers, MCP servers, or workspace indexing).
