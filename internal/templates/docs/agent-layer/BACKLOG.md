# Backlog

Note: This is an agent-layer memory file. It is primarily for agent use.

## Purpose
Unscheduled user-visible features and tasks (distinct from issues; not refactors). Maintainability refactors belong in ISSUES.md.

## Format
- Insert new entries immediately below `<!-- ENTRIES START -->` (most recent first).
- Keep each entry **3–5 lines**.
- Line 1 starts with `- Backlog YYYY-MM-DD <id>:` and a short title.
- Lines 2–5 are indented by **4 spaces** and use `Key: Value`.
- Keep **exactly one blank line** between entries.
- Prevent duplicates: search the file and merge/rewrite instead of adding near-duplicates.
- When scheduled into ROADMAP.md, move the work into ROADMAP.md and remove it from this file.
- When implemented, remove the entry from this file.

### Entry template
