# Commands

Note: This is an agent-layer memory file. It is primarily for agent use.

## Purpose
Canonical, repeatable **development workflow** commands for this repository (setup, build, run, test, coverage, lint/format, typecheck, migrations, scripts). This file is not for application/CLI usage documentation.

## Format
- Prefer commands that are stable and will be used repeatedly. Avoid one-off debugging commands.
- Organize commands using headings that fit the repo. Create headings as needed.
- If the repo is a monorepo, group commands per workspace/package/service and specify the working directory.
- When commands change, update this file and remove stale entries.
- Insert entries (and any needed headings) below `<!-- ENTRIES START -->`.
