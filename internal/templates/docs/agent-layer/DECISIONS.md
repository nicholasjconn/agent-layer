# Decisions

Purpose: Rolling log of important decisions (brief).

Notes for updates:
- Add an entry when making a significant decision (architecture, storage, data model, interface boundaries, dependency choice).
- Keep entries brief.
- Do not log decisions that have no future ramifications or simply restate best practices or existing instructions.
- Keep the oldest decisions near the top and add new entries at the bottom.
- Lines below the first line must be indented by 4 spaces so they stay associated with the entry.

Entry format:
- Decision YYYY-MM-DD abcdef: Short title
    Decision: <what was chosen>
    Reason: <why it was chosen>
    Tradeoffs: <what is gained and what is lost>
