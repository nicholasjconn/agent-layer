# Features

Purpose: Backlog of deferred user-visible feature requests (not yet scheduled into the roadmap).

Notes for updates:
- Add an entry only when it is a new user-visible capability.
- Keep each entry 3 to 5 lines (the first line plus 2 to 4 indented lines).
- Lines 2 to 5 must be indented by 4 spaces so they stay associated with the entry.
- Prevent duplicates by searching and merging.
- When a feature is scheduled into a roadmap phase, move it into `docs/agent-layer/ROADMAP.md` and remove it from this file.
- When a feature is implemented, ensure it is removed from this file.

Entry format:
- Feature YYYY-MM-DD abcdef: Short title
    Priority: Critical, High, Medium, or Low. Area: <area>
    Capability: <what the user should be able to do>
    Acceptance criteria: <clear condition to consider it done>
    Notes: <optional dependencies or constraints>
