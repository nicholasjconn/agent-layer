# Roadmap

Note: This is an agent-layer memory file. It is primarily for agent use.

## Purpose
A phased plan of work that guides architecture decisions and sequencing. The roadmap is the “what next” reference; the backlog holds unscheduled items.

## Format
- The roadmap is a single list of numbered phases under `<!-- PHASES START -->`.
- Do not renumber completed phases (phases marked with ✅).
- You may renumber incomplete phases when updating the roadmap (e.g., to insert a new phase).
- Incomplete phases include **Goal**, **Tasks** (checkbox list), and **Exit criteria** sections.
- When a phase is complete:
  - update the heading to: `## Phase N ✅ — <phase name>`
  - replace the phase content with a short bullet summary of what was accomplished (no checkbox list).

### Phase templates

Completed:
```markdown
## Phase N ✅ — <phase name>
- <Accomplishment summary bullet>
- <Accomplishment summary bullet>
```

Incomplete:
```markdown
## Phase N — <phase name>

### Goal
- <What success looks like for this phase, in 1–3 bullet points.>

### Tasks
- [ ] <Concrete deliverable-oriented task>
- [ ] <Concrete deliverable-oriented task>

### Exit criteria
- <Objective condition that must be true to call the phase complete.>
- <Prefer testable statements: “X exists”, “Y passes”, “Z is documented”.>
```
