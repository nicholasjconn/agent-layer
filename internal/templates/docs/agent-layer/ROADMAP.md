# Roadmap

Purpose: Phased plan of work; guides architecture decisions and sequencing.

Update rules:
- The roadmap is a single list of numbered phases.
- Do not renumber completed phases (phases marked with ✅).
- You may renumber incomplete phases when updating the roadmap (for example, to insert a new phase).
- Incomplete phases include Goal, Tasks (checkbox list), and Exit criteria.
- When a phase is complete:
  - Add a green check emoji to the phase heading: `## Phase N ✅ — <name>`
  - Replace the phase content with a single bullet list summarizing what was accomplished (no checkbox list).
- There is no separate "current" or "upcoming" section. The phase list itself shows what is done vs not done.


Phase template (completed):
## Phase N ✅ — <phase name>
- <Accomplishment summary bullet>
- <Accomplishment summary bullet>


Phase template (incomplete):
## Phase N — <phase name>

### Goal
- <What success looks like for this phase, in 1 to 3 bullet points.>

### Tasks
- [ ] <Concrete deliverable-oriented task>
- [ ] <Concrete deliverable-oriented task>

### Exit criteria
- <Objective condition that must be true to call the phase complete.>
- <Prefer testable statements: “X exists”, “Y passes”, “Z is documented”.>
