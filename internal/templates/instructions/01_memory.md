# Dedicated Memory Section (paste into system instructions)

## Project memory files (authoritative, user-editable, agent-maintained)
- `docs/agent-layer/ISSUES.md` — deferred defects, maintainability refactors, technical debt, risks.
- `docs/agent-layer/FEATURES.md` — backlog of deferred user feature requests (not yet scheduled into the roadmap).
- `docs/agent-layer/ROADMAP.md` — numbered phases; guides architecture and sequencing.
- `docs/agent-layer/DECISIONS.md` — rolling log of important decisions (brief).
- `docs/agent-layer/COMMANDS.md` — canonical, repeatable commands for this repository. Sections are team-defined.

After this list, refer to memory files by filename only (ISSUES.md, FEATURES.md, ROADMAP.md, DECISIONS.md, COMMANDS.md).

These memory rules are canonical and are not repeated elsewhere.

## Operating rules
1. **Read before planning:** Before making architectural or cross-cutting decisions, read `ROADMAP.md`, then scan `DECISIONS.md`, and then check relevant entries in `FEATURES.md` and `ISSUES.md`.
2. **Read before running commands:** Before running or recommending project commands (tests, coverage, build, lint, start services), check `COMMANDS.md` first. `COMMANDS.md` is only for development workflow commands (build, test, lint, format, coverage, migrations, scripts), not application or CLI usage documentation. If it is missing, ask the user before creating it by copying `.agent-layer/templates/docs/COMMANDS.md` into `COMMANDS.md`. If it is incomplete, use auto-discovery, ask the user only when needed, then update `COMMANDS.md` with the definitive approach.
3. **Initialize if missing:** If any project memory file does not exist, ask the user before creating it. If approved, copy `.agent-layer/templates/docs/<NAME>.md` into `<NAME>.md` (preserve headings and markers).
   - If `.agent-layer/templates/docs/COMMANDS.md` does not exist, ask the user before creating `COMMANDS.md` with a minimal, readable structure and a single `<!-- ENTRIES START -->` insertion marker.
4. **Write down deferred work:** If you discover something worth doing and you are not doing it now:
   - Add it to `ISSUES.md` if it is a bug, maintainability refactor, technical debt, reliability, security, test coverage gap, performance concern, or other engineering risk.
   - Add it to `FEATURES.md` only if it is a new user-visible capability.
5. **Maintainability refactors are always issues:** Do not put refactors in `FEATURES.md`.
6. **FEATURES is a backlog, not a schedule:** `FEATURES.md` holds unscheduled feature requests. Periodically move selected features into `ROADMAP.md` tasks, then remove them from `FEATURES.md` to keep the backlog lean.
7. **Keep entries compact and readable:** Each issue and feature entry should be **3 to 5 lines**:
   - Line 1: `Issue YYYY-MM-DD abcdef:` or `Feature YYYY-MM-DD abcdef:` plus a short title (use a leading `-` list item).
   - Lines 2 to 5: Indent by **4 spaces** to associate the lines with the entry.
   - Line 2: Priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and area.
   - Line 3: Short description focused on the observed problem or requested capability.
   - Line 4: Next step (for issues) or acceptance criteria (for features).
   - Line 5: Optional dependencies or notes (only if needed).
8. **Prevent duplicates:** Search the target file before adding a new entry. Merge or rewrite existing entries instead of adding near-duplicates.
9. **Keep files living:** When an issue is fixed, remove it from `ISSUES.md`. When a feature is implemented, remove it from `FEATURES.md`. When a feature is scheduled into the roadmap, move it into `ROADMAP.md` and remove it from `FEATURES.md` at that time.
10. **Roadmap phase behavior:**
    - The roadmap is a single list of **numbered phases**.
    - Do not renumber completed phases (phases marked with ✅).
    - You may renumber incomplete phases when updating the roadmap (for example, to insert a new phase).
    - Incomplete phases have **Goal**, **Tasks** (checkbox list), and **Exit criteria** sections.
    - When a phase is complete, add a green check emoji to the phase heading (✅) and replace the phase content with a **single bullet list** summarizing what was accomplished (no checkbox list).
    - There is no separate "current" or "upcoming" section; done vs not done is indicated by the ✅.
11. **Decision logging:** When making a significant decision (architecture, storage, data model, interface boundaries, dependency choice), add an entry to `DECISIONS.md` using `Decision YYYY-MM-DD abcdef:` with decision, reason, and tradeoffs. Keep it brief and add new entries at the bottom so the oldest decisions remain at the top. Do not log decisions that have no future ramifications or simply restate best practices or existing instructions.
12. **COMMANDS.md maintenance (seamless, selective):**
    - Maintain `COMMANDS.md` without asking for confirmation when it improves future work.
    - `COMMANDS.md` is for development workflow commands only; do not document application or CLI usage there.
    - Only add commands that are expected to be used repeatedly, such as:
      - setup and installation, development server, build, lint and format, typecheck, unit and integration tests, coverage, database migrations, common scripts.
    - Do not add one-off debugging commands (search/grep/find, ad-hoc scripts, temporary environment variables) unless they are a stable part of the workflow.
    - Keep `COMMANDS.md` concise and structured, but **do not hard-code sections**. Sections are team-defined.
    - When adding a command:
      - place it under the best existing heading, or create a new heading if none fits,
      - include purpose, command, where to run it, and prerequisites,
      - prefer headings named **Test** and **Coverage** when applicable (for discoverability), but do not require them.
    - Deduplicate and update entries when commands change.
13. **Agent autonomy:** You may propose and apply updates to the roadmap, features, issues, decisions, and commands when it improves clarity and delivery, while keeping the documents compact.
