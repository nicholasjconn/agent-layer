description: Post-task wrap-up: reflect on recent changes, update project memory files (ISSUES/FEATURES/ROADMAP/DECISIONS) with compact deduplicated entries, run fast verification, and summarize.
---

# Post-task cleanup and project memory update

## Intent
After completing a task, perform a focused wrap-up that:
- validates what was changed (and what was not),
- captures **deferred work** and **risks** in the project memory files,
- removes items that are now fixed,
- runs the fastest credible verification,
- produces a clear summary for a human reviewer.

This is **not** a full codebase audit. Only document what you touched or passively observed during the task.

---

## Project memory files (authoritative)
- `docs/agent-layer/ISSUES.md` — deferred defects, maintainability refactors, technical debt, risks.
- `docs/agent-layer/FEATURES.md` — backlog of deferred user feature requests (not yet scheduled into the roadmap).
- `docs/agent-layer/ROADMAP.md` — numbered phases; guides architecture and sequencing.
- `docs/agent-layer/DECISIONS.md` — rolling log of important decisions (brief).

If any are missing, ask the user before creating them. If approved, copy `.agent-layer/templates/docs/<NAME>.md` into `docs/agent-layer/<NAME>.md` (preserve headings and markers).

---

## Optional guidance from the user
If the user provides extra direction, interpret it as:

- Scope: default to uncommitted changes; the user may request since last commit, a specific git range, or explicit paths.
- Plan file path: use `.agent-layer/tmp/implementation_plan.md`.
- Verification depth and risk level: default to automatic verification with medium risk.
- Roadmap updates: default to automatic updates when the work maps to roadmap tasks; skip if the user asks to avoid updates.
- Maximum new entries across memory files: default to 10.

---

## Roles and handoffs (multi-agent)
1. **Change Reviewer**: enumerates what changed, checks plan alignment, and notes passive observations.
2. **Memory Curator**: updates `ISSUES/FEATURES/ROADMAP/DECISIONS` with compact deduplicated entries; removes resolved items.
3. **Verifier**: runs the best available fast checks; escalates when risk warrants.
4. **Reporter**: summarizes outcomes (what changed, what was logged/removed, what was verified).

If only one agent is available, execute phases in this order with explicit headings.

---

## Global constraints
- Keep scope tight. No opportunistic refactors.
- Do not start a broad audit; focus on touched files and nearby context only.
- Follow the memory formatting rules:
  - Each entry is **3 to 5 lines**.
  - Line 1 starts with `- Issue YYYY-MM-DD abcdef:` or `- Feature YYYY-MM-DD abcdef:` plus a short title.
  - Lines 2–5 are indented by **4 spaces** and include priority/area, description, next step or acceptance criteria, and optional notes.
  - No abbreviations. Prefer full words and short sentences.
  - Prevent duplicates: search before adding; merge instead of creating near-duplicates.
  - When fixed/implemented: remove the entry from the ledger.

---

# Phase 0 — Preflight (Change Reviewer)

1. Establish baseline:
   - `git status --porcelain`
   - `git diff --stat`
2. Determine a reference identifier for entries:
   - Preferred: `git rev-parse --short HEAD` (use as `abcdef`)
   - If git is unavailable: use `nogit` as the identifier.

3. Build the review file list based on `scope`:

- Default to uncommitted changes:
  - staged: `git diff --name-only --staged`
  - unstaged: `git diff --name-only`
- If the user requests since last commit:
  - `git show --name-only --pretty="" HEAD`
- If the user provides a git range:
  - `git diff --name-only <range>`
- If the user provides explicit paths:
  - use those paths directly

If the file list is empty:
- state “No changed files detected” and proceed with memory cleanup only (dedup/removal).

**Deliverable**
- List of files reviewed
- Short SHA used for ledger entries (or `nogit`)
- Whether the working tree is clean/dirty

---

# Phase 1 — Reflect on recent work (Change Reviewer)

## 1A) Plan alignment (if a plan exists)
If `.agent-layer/tmp/implementation_plan.md` exists:
- read it
- compare planned tasks vs actual changes
- list:
  - completed items
  - omissions
  - deviations (and why)

If `.agent-layer/tmp/implementation_plan.md` does not exist:
- state that no plan artifact was found and skip plan alignment.

## 1B) Passive best-practice check (no broad audit)
Review only:
- the files in scope,
- any directly related modules you opened during the task,
- relevant standards in `README.md` (only as needed to judge compliance).

Capture:
- over-complication / unnecessary abstraction noticed while implementing
- best-practice violations observed (naming, layering, error handling, boundary validation)
- band-aids / workaround patterns you encountered
- risky fallbacks/defaults that may hide failures

**Output of this phase**
- A concise bullet list of “Findings to log” grouped by:
  - Bugs / correctness risks
  - Maintainability / technical debt
  - Reliability / security / performance
  - User-visible feature ideas (only if truly user-facing)
  - Significant decisions made (architecture, interface boundaries, storage/data model, dependency choice)

---

# Phase 2 — Update project memory files (Memory Curator)

## 2A) Ensure memory files exist
For each of:
- `docs/agent-layer/ISSUES.md`
- `docs/agent-layer/FEATURES.md`
- `docs/agent-layer/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/agent-layer/DECISIONS.md`

If missing:
- ask the user before creating it. If approved, copy `.agent-layer/templates/docs/<NAME>.md` into `docs/agent-layer/<NAME>.md` (preserve headings and markers).

## 2B) Decide where each finding belongs
- Add to **`docs/agent-layer/ISSUES.md`** if it is:
  - a bug, correctness defect, maintainability refactor, technical debt, reliability gap, security concern, test gap, performance concern, or engineering risk.
- Add to **`docs/agent-layer/FEATURES.md`** only if it is a **new user-visible capability** request.
- Add to **`docs/agent-layer/DECISIONS.md`** if the task required a significant decision:
  - record decision, reason, and tradeoffs
  - keep it brief and add new entries at the bottom so the oldest decisions remain at the top
- Update **`docs/agent-layer/ROADMAP.md`** only if the user asks for roadmap updates, or if automatic updates are appropriate and:
  - the completed work clearly maps to existing roadmap tasks, or
  - the roadmap is now stale/contradicted by what was implemented.

## 2C) Prevent duplicates before writing
Before adding a new entry:
- search the target file for key terms and nearby titles
- if a near-duplicate exists:
  - merge the new information into the existing entry
  - keep the final entry within 3–5 lines

## 2D) Entry formatting rules (mandatory)
### Issues (`docs/agent-layer/ISSUES.md`)
Add entries in this format (example):
- `- Issue 2026-01-10 abcdef: Short title`
    `Priority: High. Area: <module or subsystem>`
    `Description: One sentence describing the observed problem.`
    `Next step: Concrete next action to take.`
    `Notes: Optional dependencies or context.`

### Features (`docs/agent-layer/FEATURES.md`)
- `- Feature 2026-01-10 abcdef: Short title`
    `Priority: Medium. Area: <user-facing area>`
    `Description: One sentence describing the requested capability.`
    `Acceptance criteria: One sentence describing what “done” means.`
    `Notes: Optional dependencies or context.`

### Decisions (`docs/agent-layer/DECISIONS.md`)
Add entries at the bottom:
- `- Decision 2026-01-10 abcdef: Short decision title`
    `Decision: What was chosen.`
    `Reason: Why it was chosen.`
    `Tradeoffs: What was sacrificed or deferred.`

## 2E) Remove resolved items
- For each issue that is now fixed by the recent work:
  - remove it from `docs/agent-layer/ISSUES.md` completely
- For each feature that is now implemented:
  - remove it from `docs/agent-layer/FEATURES.md`

## 2F) Consolidate and keep files readable
- Merge duplicates.
- Ensure entries remain compact (3–5 lines).
- Ensure no abbreviations.
- Keep the file easy to scan (follow the existing ordering convention for that file).

## 2G) Respect entry limits
Do not add more than the entry cap across all memory files in a single run.
If more exist:
- add the most impactful first
- summarize the remainder in the final report as “not logged due to limit”

---

# Phase 3 — Regression test and verification (Verifier)

## 3A) Choose verification level
- If the user explicitly requests no verification, skip it and clearly document the limitation.
- If the user requests fast verification, run the repo’s fast checks.
- If the user requests full verification, run the repo’s full checks.
- Otherwise:
  - default to fast checks
  - escalate toward full checks when risk is high or changes touch core infrastructure, build pipelines, or public interfaces.

## 3B) Prefer repo-defined commands
Attempt, in order, depending on what exists in the repository:
- `make test-fast` (preferred when available)
- `task test-fast` / `just test-fast`
- `turbo run test --filter=...` (if turbo is present and configured)
- `npm/pnpm/yarn test` (if package scripts define a fast lane)
- any documented “quick checks” in `README.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md`

If no credible commands exist:
- run the smallest applicable sanity check (compile/typecheck/syntax) only if the repo clearly supports it
- otherwise record “No verification command available” in the report

## 3C) If verification fails
- Fix failures only if the fix is directly connected to the recent work and remains in-scope.
- If the failure indicates a broader problem:
  - log it to `docs/agent-layer/ISSUES.md`
  - stop further scope expansion.

---

# Phase 4 — Final report (Reporter)

Provide a structured summary:

## Summary
- Files reviewed (count + list or top-level directories)
- Plan alignment (if applicable): omissions/deviations
- Memory updates:
  - issues added (titles only)
  - issues removed (titles only)
  - features added/removed (titles only)
  - decisions logged (titles only)
  - roadmap updates (if any)
- Verification:
  - commands run
  - pass/fail
  - limitations (if any)

## Out-of-scope discoveries
List any out-of-scope items that were observed and where they were logged (ISSUES/FEATURES), or note if they were not logged due to the entry cap.

---

# Phase 5 — Cleanup (Reporter)

- If `.agent-layer/tmp/implementation_plan.md` was used and the run completed successfully:
  - delete `.agent-layer/tmp/implementation_plan.md` only if it exists
  - delete any other workflow-generated files explicitly listed in the workflow that was just completed, only if they exist and are under `.agent-layer/tmp`
  - do not delete any other files
- If `.agent-layer/tmp/implementation_plan.md` does not exist, state that cleanup was not needed.

---

## Definition of done
- Recent work has been reviewed for plan alignment and passive best-practice concerns.
- Project memory files are up to date, deduplicated, and compact.
- Fixed issues/features have been removed from their ledgers.
- Plan file cleanup is complete (`.agent-layer/tmp/implementation_plan.md` deleted if it existed).
- Fast verification has been run (or explicitly skipped with a clear limitation note).
